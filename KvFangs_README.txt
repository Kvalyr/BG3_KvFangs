Fangs & Horns
by Kvalyr

Dynamic Appearance Framework is Required for this mod


Description:
This mod adds standalone Vampire Fangs, Tiefling Fangs and Tiefling/Devil Horns that can be added to other characters using DAF - Dynamic Appearance Framework.


Limitations:
Not all Visuals fit all character models
* Currently, the Fangs and Horns can be applied to any character but will only actually fit Humans, Elves, Drow, Githyanki and Tieflings (i.e.; Races with human-like proportions).
* 'Strong' body types may experiencing clipping issues or visuals appearing too low and otherwise out-of-place.
* Other races such as Dragonborn, Half-Orcs, Gnomes, Halflings & Dwarves will require custom meshes in future versions of the mod.


Installation:
* Install Dynamic Appearance Framework and its requirements.
* Install this mod the same as any other mod that comes in a .pak file
* Load order shouldn't matter for these mods


How to Use:
* See this article for instructions on how to use the Dynamic Appearance Framework: https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/articles/190
* See this article for instructions on how to use the visuals from this mod: https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/articles/193


Uninstallation:
* It's almost never a good idea to remove mods from an ongoing playthrough.
* Removing any visuals applied from this mod before saving should make it safe to uninstall, but it's not guaranteed.
* A later version of Dynamic Appearance Framework will make it easier/safer to uninstall.


FAQ:

Q: These options aren't showing up for me in character creation. Why?
A: That's not what this mod does. This mod adds these visuals as to DAF so that you can apply them to a character at any time; not at character creation.

Q: Why are teeth and gums floating outside my character's head? Why are my horns floating above my hair? Why are my horns growing out of my forehead?
A: Scroll back up to the 'Limitations' section and re-read.

Q: Why are there so few options? When can we get more?
A: The process of making new visuals available is somewhat tedious and time-consuming. I'll add more over time, as time allows.

Q: Can you [please] add X?
A: I don't take requests for new options, sorry. I'll try to make a broad selection of visuals available for as many body types as I can manage.

Planned Features:
* All Tiefling horn options
* Variants of existing options that fit better for different races/bodies
